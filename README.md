* jQuery

## Description

Website takes a number as input from the user. It outputs a list ranging from 0 to this number, but replaces certain numbers with certain phrases.

The rules for the replacements are:
* Numbers that contain a 1 in any digit are replaced with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2 in any digit are replaced with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3 in any digit are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

These rules are listed from lowest to highest priority. So, for example, 23 would become "Won't you be my neighbor?", because the rule for 3 is prioritized above the one for 2.
